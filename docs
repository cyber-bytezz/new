📧 Email Flow Technical Documentation
1. Core Infrastructure & Servers
The application uses Azure Communication Services (ACS) as the dedicated email delivery server.

Service Provider: Microsoft Azure
Protocol: Azure SDK (via HTTPS)
Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL (Stores interview details and tracking timestamps)
2. Environment Variables (.env)
The following keys must be configured in the .env file for the email flow to function:

Variable	Description	Example/Value
AZURE_COMMUNICATION_ENDPOINT	The Azure ACS resource endpoint.	https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com/
AZURE_COMMUNICATION_ACCESS_KEY	Secret key for Azure authentication.	Abc123... (Primary Key)
AZURE_COMMUNICATION_MAIL	The verified "From" email address.	DoNotReply@hexaware.com
FRONTEND_INTERVIEW_BASE_URL	Base URL used to generate candidate links.	https://aitalentquest.tensai.run
3. Key Endpoints
Backend (Internal Logic)
Trigger Endpoint: POST /schedule
File: 
backend/app/routers/schedules.py
Action: Receives interview payload, creates DB entries, and triggers the email service.
Frontend (Candidate Landing)
Interview Link: {FRONTEND_URL}/login?interview_id={ID}
Sent inside the email button (START INTERVIEW).
4. Logic Execution Flow
Request: The Recruiter submits a schedule via the Dashboard.
Service Layer: 
create_schedule_service
 (in 
interview_schedule.py
) generates a Schedules record and an Interviews record.
Link Generation: 
generate_interview_link
 (in 
email_utils.py
) creates a secure URL for the candidate.
Payload Preparation: 
email_generator.py
 injects candidate name, date, and link into an HTML/CSS template.
Dispatch: The EmailClient from the azure-communication-email library sends the message using the AZURE_COMMUNICATION_ENDPOINT.
Confirmation: On success, the backend records invitation_sent_at in the database to track delivery.
